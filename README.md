# STOCK ANALYSIS

The objective of this challenge was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to obtain specific information on stocks in the years 2017 and 2018 and perform an analysis to see if it is valid to invest in those stocks.

# THE DATABASE

The database that they presented to us included two graphs with stock information for different shares, this information contains a market value, the date the shares were issued, the adjusted opening, closing and closing price, the highest price and lower, and the volume of the action. The goal is to recover the ticker, the total daily volume and the performance of each stock.

# THE ANALYSIS

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring the code?

Among the advantages of refactoring we can find that the information is more understandable, thanks to this, procedures such as reformulation and restructuring or elimination of phrases are used, in code refactoring, methods such as encapsulation, reformatting or elimination are applied. to optimize the code without changing its content.

The disadvantages is that an imprecise refactoring could generate new bugs and errors in the code also that there is no clear definition of what a clean or well structured code is and when refactoring is done by large teams, reaching agreements could be more work than expected.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Some of the advantages we found are a better understanding facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the software, the restructuring of the source code can be done without changing the functionality, the elimination of redundancies increases the efficiency of the code, a well-structured code, with methods and Classes shorter and self-contained, you can challenge yourself more easily.

In the original book it took about a second to run, while our new analysis only took about four of the time (about 0.25 seconds) to run.
